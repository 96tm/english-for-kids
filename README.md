# English for kids (client-server)

This app was made as a final project for a Front-end course by <a href="https://rs.school/">The Rolling Scopes School</a>.
It's built using TypeScript and Webpack for bundling.
You can select a category and start learning a set of words loaded on the server.
New categories can be added dynamically by connecting to the server (by default, a login page appears at startup with filled credentials - after logging in you can use admin interface to edit cards and categories). You can find the server code <a href="https://github.com/96tm/english-for-kids-server/tree/develop">here</a>.
There's also a version of this app working without a server in <a href="https://github.com/96tm/english-for-kids/tree/develop">this branch</a>.
This app is <a href="https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/96tm-JSFE2021Q1/english-for-kids-part-one/">deployed here</a>.
