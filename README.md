# English for kids

This app was made as a final project for a Front-end course by <a href="https://rs.school/">The Rolling Scopes School</a>.
It's built using TypeScript and Webpack for bundling.
You can select a category and start learning a predefined set of words.
New categories can be added statically by editing file `public/cards.json` and adding assets to `public/audio` and `public/img`.
There's also a version of this app working with a server in <a href="https://github.com/96tm/english-for-kids/tree/client-server">this branch</a>.
